# Account verification

This application takes a user through the account verification process using the BasiqConnectControl UI component.

It is built with a React FE, Express/NodeJS backend.

Before you can spin up you will need to create a `.env` file and create a variable `BASIQ_API_KEY` in which you store your applications API key.
